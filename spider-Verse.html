                        <p>During a student visit to the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences at the UBA, sponsored by the General Techtronics Corporation, Peter was bitten by a spider that had been exposed to the radioactive experiments that were being carried out there. Unbeknownst to him, the spider fell from his hand and also bit a girl, Cindy Moon, on the ankle before she died from the radiation. This caused Parker to gradually acquire superhuman powers: speed, strength and agility proportional to those of a spider of his size; a "spider sense" that warns him of danger and the ability to adhere to and move along any wall or wall, regardless of its horizontality. He then manages to build a mechanism that allows him to launch a viscous chemical product in the form of a spider web.</p>
   <p>Once prepared, he appeared on television and was an immediate success. After finishing the program, Peter let a thief escape, even though he could have easily stopped him. A few days later, when he returned home, he found that his uncle Ben had been killed by a thief, who had taken refuge in an abandoned warehouse, where the police had surrounded him. Heartbroken, he again adopted the identity of Spider-Man and quickly captured him, discovering that it was the same thief he had let escape from the television studios. From that day on, he decided to fight crime under the teaching that "With great power comes great responsibility."</p>

                        <p>Spider-Man Noir is an alternate version of Peter Parker in the 1930s.Driven by the idealism and values taught to him by his aunt and uncle May and Ben, reckless young Peter Parker embraces journalism as a force to fight evil and empower the innocent and needy.</p> 

                        <p>After Peter mistakenly receives a clandestine report for Urich from an informant called the Fly, the young man ventures into a warehouse where the Goblin's men are unloading a shipment of stolen antiquities. An ancient but peculiar spider statue breaks and releases a horde of arachnids. One of the spiders bites Peter, causing him to lose consciousness and while unconscious, he dreams of a spider god. When he awakens, he finds himself hanging from a black web that envelops his entire body. This incident imbues Peter with superhuman abilities similar to those of a spider.</p>

                        <p>Jessica Drew was the daughter of American anthropologist Johnatan Drew and his British wife Merriam. At the age of fourteen, Jessica contracted uranium poisoning due to her father's work, but Jonathan and Wyndham saved her life with a serum derived from a spider and years of hibernation in a genetic accelerator, where she received subliminal education via special tapes.</p>
                        <p>Meriem Drew was killed shortly after by a werewolf, Gregor Russoff, and while Jessica slept, the Elder God Chthon, trapped on Mount Wundagore, attempted to escape. Jonathan, now possessed by the centuries-old ghost Magnus, joined with Wyndham, now the High Evolutionary, and his evolved animal Knights of Wundagore to defeat Chthon. However, Chthon forged a mystical bond with Jessica. </p>
                        <p>After decades in hibernation, Jessica awoke having aged only to her pre-teens, and cured of all traces of radioactivity by the High Evolutionary. She had also gained superpowers due to the combination of her radiation exposure and her father's spider serum. Jessica grew up under the care of Bova, an evolved cow, but was treated with distrust by the rest of the evolved animals as the High Evolutionary became engrossed in his work.</p>

                        <p>After an ordinary day, pink clouds with purple lightning appeared over Manhattan and the Avengers arrived. Spider-Man arrived and Colonel America asked him to take Ash J. Williams to a mental hospital, after insisting that monsters (which he mistook for the Zombie Sentry) called Deadites were coming to destroy everything.</p>
                        <p>As they swing, Colonel America leaps up and bites Spider-Man, causing him to fall from a great height and drop Ash. However, thanks to his special physiology, his own immune system was able to slow down the infection, allowing Parker to pose as an infected person and threaten to devour Hawkeye if they did not give in to hand over Williams. Reluctantly, the former Mightiest Heroes agree to let the traveler go, who is quickly carried by the spider to a safe rooftop. After clarifying the delay of his infection, Parker and Williams watch in horror as both humans and former heroes are infected and/or eaten.</p>

Shortly after this she was contacted by Ezekiel Sims who warned her about The Inheritors and the special role she would play in all this and to protect her from Morlun, Ezekiel locked her in a secret vault, isolating her for years from the rest of the world.</p>
                        <p>During the 10 years that Silk was imprisoned, she was always aware of Spider-Man's identity, and became a huge fan and follower of his. When the Watcher's Eye exploded, Peter discovered Cindy's existence and whereabouts.

Unfortunately however, Peter was captured and interrogated by King James, then sent to Roanoke with Robert Banner to attempt to kill Fury but not before allowing him to witness the live execution of Dr. Strange. When Fury had sacrificed himself with the rest of the crew sent to kill him, he told Peter that he would let him kill him if he wanted, but Peter simply let him. After Fury and the heroes had resolved the situation with the time portal, a gamma radiation release caused Banner to jump in to protect Peter; the radiation from the portal's anomaly turned him into the Hulk; Virginia offered to let him stay with her and her father at the colony. Peter accepted, planning to get his aunt and uncle out of England to join him. He was later bitten by a spider that had been exposed to the portal's temporal energies and was gifted as a 'Witchbreed'.</p>
                        <p>As Peter grows up, he takes on the heroic identity of "The Spider" and falls in love with Virginia Dare.</p>

                        <p>Eventually, as an adult and a genius in nuclear physics, Bruce longed to make philanthropic marks in science, but was unable to receive any funding for his projects. So lacking other options, he opted to work at a SHIELD nuclear research facility at Desert Base, New Mexico. </p>
                        <p>Years later, Bruce tests one of his latest inventions, the gamma bomb (also called the G-Bomb); an atomic weapon capable of generating large amounts of gamma radiation. During the first test of the bomb, a young man named Peter Parker, motivated by a youthful dream, entered the blast zone. As a result of this event, young Parker is transformed into the Hulk. </p>
                        <p>Banner returned to work, as he began dissecting a spider that survived the same explosion that transformed Peter. The spider bit him, altering his DNA. Because he was bitten as an adult, his body was unable to cope with the mutation, and he transformed into a spider-like humanoid creature. After being on the run for two years, Bruce is captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. and becomes Spider-Man after having his mutation under control. </p>

                        <p>Peter Parker was a normal boy until an accident gave him spider-like powers, turning him into the hero known as Spider-Man. Imbued with a strong sense of responsibility, the young man combined as best he could his life as an adventurer with that of a normal boy, with his job as a photographer at the Daily Bugle, a loving aunt (May Reilly) and a girlfriend (Gwen Stacy) who loved him.  </p>
                        <p>However, in a moment of weakness, Peter used his scientific knowledge to try to find a way to reverse his powers so he could lead a normal life with his girlfriend, but the experiment was a failure and instead of reversing his spider-powers, they increased and he grew two extra pairs of arms.</p>
                        <p>A battle with Doc Oc showed him that his arms could be useful. Thanks to Reed Richards, he made them invisible, too, to hide them in his private life, one that he gradually abandoned. He became loved by everyone and even saved Gwen Stacy from falling to her death. And he became a spokesman for the disadvantaged and different.</p>

                        <p>This Spiderman is not very different from the one in the 616 universe, his origin is the same, Peter was a nerdy and common teenager, until he is bitten by a radioactive spider and receives powers, suffering for the death of his uncle, he understands that with great power comes great responsibility, the only difference is that the risks he ran in his career as a Superhero were very great, to the point that a confrontation with the Sinister 6 left him very badly injured, that many parts of his body had to be replaced with robot parts, becoming a Cyborg.</p>
                        <p>Cyborg, has basically the same powers as Peter Parker from Earth 616, but because his body was reinforced with technology in most of his body, he gained impressive superhuman strength, surpassing the strength he had before becoming a Cyborg, gaining more durability against physical attacks, and his robotic arm is equipped with a laser cannon, and on his back he has a sonic amplifier, with certain self-repair capabilities, and being able to connect with external technological devices, with an incredible database, although it is unknown if he can fly.</p>
